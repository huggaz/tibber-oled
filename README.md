A small project to display the current tibber price on a 128x64 pixel OLED display. Works find on a banana pi and raspberry pi. 
The display changes every 30 seconds between date&time and current price and a chart previewing the next 12 hours price. 

Also on the first screen an icon is shown to view at a quick glance if the price is cheap or not.
